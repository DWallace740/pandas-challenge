# PyCitySchools Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes data from various schools to assess student performance in math and reading. The analysis includes comparisons of school size, type (charter vs. district), and per-student spending to determine how these factors affect student outcomes.

## Files
-**PyCitySchools**: Folder containing the jupyter source file and "Resources" folder. 

- **PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook where the analysis and calculations were performed.

-**Written Report Panda Challenge.txt**: The written report with a summarized analysis and conclusions.

- **Resources**: Folder containing the dataset used for the analysis.
  - `schools_complete.csv`: Contains information about each school.
  - `students_complete.csv`: Contains information about each student.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   git clone <https://github.com/DWallace740/pandas-challenge.git>
2. Install the required dependencies by running: 
    pip install pandas jupyterlab
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: 
    jupyter notebook
4. Run the cells to perform the analysis. 

##Summary
-The analysis explores the relationship between school size, spending, and student outcomes. 

- Conclusions show that spending more money per student doesn't always lead to better results and that charter schools tend to outperform district schools.

## Resources and Support 
For this project, I used multiple resources to ensure the successful completion of the assignment: 
- **ChatGPT (AI Assistant)**: For guidance on code logic, debugging, structuring the scripts and formatting my Readme file. 
- **Tutoring Sessions**: I completed a tutoring session to further refine my understanding of coding, project requirements and Github.
- All external resources used are listed here for transparency. 

## Code Cleanliness and Comments 
- Both scripts have been throughly cleaned and commented. 

## Acknowledgements

I have completed the project with the assistance of the resources mentioned above and have followed all guidelines for collaboration and external assistance.
